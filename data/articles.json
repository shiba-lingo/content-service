    "content": "A contingent of United States federal authorities is poised to curtail the volume of air traffic at forty of the nation’s most heavily utilized aerodromes, an intervention designed to alleviate the systemic strain currently afflicting the air traffic control infrastructure. The operational integrity of US control towers has been demonstrably compromised by widespread absenteeism, attributable directly to controllers engaging in sick leave maneuvers because of their uncompensated service.\n\nThe genesis of this operational crisis lies in the legislative body's failure to enact an appropriations bill, a fiscal lapse that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of federal employees being deprived of their customary remuneration. It was this very funding deadlock which, as of Wednesday, metastasized into the protracted governmental cessation of operations in the annals of US history.\n\nThough the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has yet to formally promulgate the specific facilities slated for reduced throughput, the complete roster, as disseminated by reliable US media outlets, is herewith appended. Crucially, international routes remain wholly exempt from these capacity reductions.\n\nThe forty airports designated for these proposed capacity adjustments are:\n\nAnchorage International (ANC), Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL), Boston Logan International (BOS), Baltimore/Washington International (BWI), Charlotte Douglas International (CLT), Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International (CVG), Dallas Love Field (DAL), Ronald Reagan Washington National (DCA), Denver International in Colorado (DEN), Dallas/Fort Worth International (DFW), Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County (DTW), Newark Liberty International (EWR), Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International (FLL), Honolulu International (HNL), Houston Hobby (HOU), Washington Dulles International (IAD), George Bush Houston Intercontinental (IAH), Indianapolis International (IND), New York John F Kennedy International (JFK), Las Vegas Harry Reid International (LAS), Los Angeles International (LAX), New York LaGuardia (LGA), Orlando International (MCO), Chicago Midway (MDW), Memphis International (MEM), Miami International (MIA), Minneapolis/St Paul International (MSP), Oakland International (OAK), Ontario International in California (ONT), Chicago O'Hare International (ORD), Portland International (PDX), Philadelphia International (PHL), Phoenix Sky Harbor International (PHX), San Diego International (SAN), Louisville International (SDF), Seattle/Tacoma International (SEA), San Francisco International (SFO), Salt Lake City International (SLC), Teterboro in New Jersey (TEB), and Tampa International (TPA).",

    "content": "US officials are making plans to reduce the number of flights at 40 of the nation's busiest airports. This action is necessary to lessen the pressure on air traffic controllers who are currently facing difficulties.\n\nAir traffic controllers are working without pay, which is leading to absences in US control towers as many controllers call in sick. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not getting their pay cheques because lawmakers have not been able to pass a budget. This disagreement over government funding became the longest shutdown in US history on Wednesday.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not yet formally announced which airports will have fewer flights. However, US media sources have published the complete list. It is important to note that international flights will not be cut.\n\nHere is the full list of the 40 airports, according to US media:\n\nAnchorage International (ANC), Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL), Boston Logan International (BOS), Baltimore/Washington International (BWI), Charlotte Douglas International (CLT), Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International (CVG), Dallas Love Field (DAL), Ronald Reagan Washington National (DCA), Denver International in Colorado (DEN), Dallas/Fort Worth International (DFW), Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County (DTW), Newark Liberty International (EWR), Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International (FLL), Honolulu International (HNL), Houston Hobby (HOU), Washington Dulles International (IAD), George Bush Houston Intercontinental (IAH), Indianapolis International (IND), New York John F Kennedy International (JFK), Las Vegas Harry Reid International (LAS), Los Angeles International (LAX), New York LaGuardia (LGA), Orlando International (MCO), Chicago Midway (MDW), Memphis International (MEM), Miami International (MIA), Minneapolis/St Paul International (MSP), Oakland International (OAK), Ontario International in California (ONT), Chicago O'Hare International (ORD), Portland International (PDX), Philadelphia International (PHL), Phoenix Sky Harbor International (PHX), San Diego International (SAN), Louisville International (SDF), Seattle/Tacoma International (SEA), San Francisco International (SFO), Salt Lake City International (SLC), Teterboro in New Jersey (TEB), and Tampa International (TPA).",
